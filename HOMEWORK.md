Task 1. Implement a component called `Cuboid` ("Prostopadłościan")
which works in a similar fashion like our `Rectangle` component.
As cuboid is a 3D figure, you will need to provide 3 properties for
width, height and depth.

You don't have to draw the Cuboid :D

Instead just calculate it's volume.
