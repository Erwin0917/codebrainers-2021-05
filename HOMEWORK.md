Task 1.

Modify the existing codebase in such way, that not just only
"Full name" triggers sorting by `fullName` field values of `students`
but that all of the columns can be used to triggers sorting.
(I.e.: if I click on **Number of lessons** column header, table
should be sorted accordingly).

Tip: pay a special attention to the case when we already clicked
one header type (eg. **Full name**) and then we clicked other
table header (eg. **Number of lessons**). Question: what should
happen, if we click **Full name** header again, i.e. in what
direction names should get sorted.

Task 1. Implement a component called `Cuboid` ("Prostopadłościan")
which works in a similar fashion like our `Rectangle` component.
As cuboid is a 3D figure, you will need to provide 3 properties for
width, height and depth.

You don't have to draw the Cuboid :D

Instead just calculate it's volume.
